SSL / TLS / HTTPS
Is TLS fast yet – A great site debunking the myths of SSL/TLS speed cost
Firesheep – A watershed moment for SSL by demonstrating the ease with which unprotected traffic can be intercepted and sessions hijacked
Qualys SSL Labs – Tests a variety of attributes of the SSL implementation by pointing it at any URL
CloudFlare – Get SSL for free on any website
Let’s Encrypt – It’s coming, and it promises to fix the current mess that is CAs and configuring certs
Betsy’s free wifi – Shows a young girl standing up a rogue wifi hot spot
Chromium HSTS preload list – All the sites submitted for HTTP strict transport security preload (a depressingly small number of them)
HTTP Shaming – Sensitive data sent insecurely? Name and shame!
DDoS
Krista’s professional DDoS service – Video of an innocent teenager promoting a DDoS service
Norse – Totally awesome real time map of DDoS attacks that’s absolutely mesmerising to watch
Booter promotional video – Very professional advert for a “booter” service (complete with “Epic DDoS interface”)
networkstresser.com – Example of a DDoS service… protected by CloudFlare… the world’s largest provider of DDoS defences…
SQL injection
sqlmap – The tool for mounting SQL injection attacks tests against a running site
Drupal 7 SQL injection flaw of 2014 – great example of how impactful it still is (patch it within 7 hours or you’re owned)
Ethical Hacking: SQL Injection – If you really want to go deep, here’s five and a half hours worth of Pluralsight content
XSS
XSSposed – List of sites found to be vulnerable to XSS (including attack vector)
Dutch banks doing the Harlem Shake – Video collage of a number of Dutch banks with XSS risks being made to do the Harlem Shake via a script reflected from the URL
XSS Filter Evasion Cheat Sheet – Because XSS payload filtering is almost always insufficient
</xssed> – Heaps of XSS news and lists of vulnerabilities
Security scanners
NetSparker – My favourite dynamic analysis tool due to ease of use and practicality (especially good for developers who may not live in security land)
OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) – Great tool for dynamic analysis security testing and has a whole raft of other users too (oh – and it’s free!)
Burp Suite – Seriously powerful with a heap of different tools and a freebie version to get you started
Fiddler – Not a security tool per se, but I use it extensively to inspect website behaviour, tamper with requests and modify responses on the wire
Acunetix – Popular dynamic analysis tool similar to NetSparker but is let down a bit in the usability stakes IMHO
Nikto2 – Freebie open source app scanner sponsored by NetSparker
Exploit databases and breach coverage
seclists.org – Heaps of exploits consolidated from various bug tracking lists
Exploit Database – Very comprehensive list of vulnerabilities
PunkSPIDER – Lots of vulnerabilities of all kinds all over the web (about 90M sites scanned with over 3M vulns at present)
Data Loss DB – Good list of breaches including stats on number of records compromised
Information is Beautiful: World’s Biggest Data Breaches – Fantastic visualisation of incidents that give a great indication of scale
Cracking software
Hashcat – The tools for cracking hashed passwords; totally free with a great supportive community
John the Ripper – Also top notch password cracking software with some different approaches to Hashcat
RainbowCrack – Rainbow tables are becoming less relevant in the era of fast GPUs and tools like Hashcat, but it’s worth a mention anyway
Aircrack-ng – For all your 802.11 WEP and WPA-PSK key cracking needs
Hacking and penetration testing tools
Metasploit – The canonical pen testing tool; seriously advanced and enormously powerful
BeEF – The Browser Exploitation Framework offering remote control over a target’s browsing session
Kali Linux – All your pen testing bits in one image!
Backtrack-linux – Fallen out of favour a bit as Kali has emerged, but still deserves a mention
Nmap – For all your mapping of network things needs
Wireshark – When you need to down to monitoring at the packet level
Vulnerability definitions
The OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks – The canonical categorisation of the top risks on the web today
SANS 20 Critical Security Controls – Great consolidation of security controls presented in an easily consumable fashion
Security headers
Fiddler extension for CSP – Massively streamlines your creation of a CSP by building the policy as you browse
SecurityHeaders.io – Everything security header related and a great place to assess your current state
Report URI – Analyse your CSP and HPKP headers plus log your exception reports there
Make any website do the Harlem Shake – if you can run this in the console against a website, they almost certainly don’t have a CSP prohibiting arbitrary content from being loaded into the site
Passwords
OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet – There are plenty of bad ways of doing it, this is a great resource documenting the good ways
Jimmy Kimmel “What is your password” – video of interviewing people and engineering them into disclosing their password
Diceware – A popular method of creating strong pass phrases suitable for use as a password
Password managers
1Password – Still my favourite password manager; client based, runs on all devices and the keychain is syncable via multiple mechanisms
LastPass – A web based password manager (albeit with rich clients as well), one of the big players in password managers
KeePass – A popular free alternative to commercial password managers
Account management
Adult Friend Finder password reset – Enumeration done wrong; initiate a password reset for any email address and be told if they’re a member of a highly personal site
Entropay password reset – A great example of not disclosing the existence of an account (try resetting an account that isn’t registered on their system)
Botnet brute force attack against GitHub – I regularly use this as an example of how hard it can be to defend against brute force
Personal security
F-Secure’s Freedome – My VPN of choice with lots of exit nodes around the world and a promise of no logging
mycreditfile.com.au – This is an Aussie version so do find one local to you if you’re not down under, but identity protection and credit alerts is a “must have” today IMHO
Googledorks
Google Hacking Database – Great collection of Googledorks categorised by various classes of exposed data
Google Hacking for Penetration Testers – In case you prefer books over web pages
Other tools and links
Have I been pwned? – How could I not include this?! My own tool, now being put to particularly good use by large enterprises monitoring tens of millions of people
Mailinator – create temporary email addresses for testing
Shodan – Find devices connected to the web (cameras, SCADA systems, etc.)
Retire.js – “What you require you must also retire”: Helps identify JavaScript libraries with known vulnerabilities
urlQuery.net – Analyses web-delivered malware by inspecting an individual URL and identifying malicious behaviour
Phish5 – I’m yet to use them but I hear good things; phishing attacks are enormously effective and these guys help you test your organisation for how well equipped people are to recognise the attacks
Plain Text Offenders – Been emailed your password? Name and shame!
Kaspersky Real Time Threat Map – Very cool visualisation of the real time threat Kaspersky is seeing
Tor Browser Bundle – Access the underwebs and browse anonymously
Security statistics reports
Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report – The annual DBIR is based on real world security incidents and is a great resource for evidence-based security metrics
WhiteHat Security Statistics Report – Based on findings in the websites they monitor with their security products so another good evidence-based report
Trustwave Global Security Report – Another annual report driven from real world investigations (plus they use the terms “threat intelligence”, “seedy criminal underground” and “data defender” so you know it’ll be good!)
Websence Threat Report – Created by Websense Security Labs, a fairly high level overview of the threat landscape
HP Cyber Risk Report – More cyber, more statistics, more reports
Noteworthy books
We are Anonymous – Still one of my favourite security books, a look inside Lulzsec and how it all unravelled
Ghost in the Wires – The story of Kevin Mitnick’s early days and an absolutely fascinating read
Data and Goliath – Just because you’re paranoid doesn't mean they’re not after you! Excellent read on data collection by Bruce Schneier
Other things you should be reading
What Every Programmer Absolutely, Positively Needs To Know About Encodings And Character Sets To Work With Text – Because encoding is one of those things you just need to know

You’ll also find examples of specific roles and career paths in each job tier so you can identify and max out skills for the role you want.
CISSP All-In-One Exam Guide
By Shon Harris. The go-to resource for CISSP exam prep. Constantly updated, the guide includes everything you will need to prepare – exam tips, practice questions, training module, in-depth explanations – and covers all 10 CISSP domains. Available in digital and print formats.
Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power
By David E. Sanger. An insider’s account of the Obama administration’s foreign policy process, Confront and Conceal reveals important details about Operation Olympic Games, the U.S.’s covert cyber attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities, and the government’s thinking on cyber weapons. Named one of the Top 20 in Rick Howard’s Cyber Canon.
Cryptography Engineering: Design Principles and Practical Applications
By Niels Ferguson, Bruce Schneier and Tadayoshi Kohno. A good foundational guide for those interested in practical cryptography. The authors cover many of the fundamentals – e.g. ciphers, message digests, key exchange, mathematics basics – and take a close look at the hardware, software and human issues involved in cryptography engineering. Advanced cryptographers will want to dig deeper.
Cyber War: The Next Threat to National Security and What to Do About It
By Richard Clarke and Robert K. Knake. First published in 2010, Clarke and Knake’s book is a broadside against complacency in cyber defense. Clarke is the former National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-terrorism for the United States, and has much to say about cyber warfare, cyber terrorism and government policy. Named one of the Top 20 in Rick Howard’s Cyber Canon.
Kingpin: How One Hacker Took Over the Billion-Dollar Cybercrime Underground
By Kevin Poulsen. Kingpin is the “made for Hollywood” story of Max Butler, a misfit and hacker who ended up gaining access to more than 1.8 million credit card accounts. A former hacker himself (he served 5 years in prison), Poulsen knows of what he speaks. Named one of the Top 20 in Rick Howard’s Cyber Canon.
No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S. Surveillance State
By Glenn Greenwald. As Howard notes in his review, No Place to Hide is “part exposé, part autobiography, and part screed ‘against the man.'” Greenwald is a columnist for The Guardian and was one of Snowden’s key contacts in the leaking of classified U.S. government secrets. Named one of the Top 20 in Rick Howard’s Cyber Canon.
The Practice of Network Security Monitoring: Understanding Incident Detection and Response
By Richard Bejtlich. A great technical primer with step-by-step instructions on how to deploy, build and run an NSM operation using open source software and vendor-neutral tools. Many reviewers comment on how readable it is compared to other books. Named one of the Top 20 in Rick Howard’s Cyber Canon.
Secrets and Lies

Perl will be used for the hands-on exercises; however every attempt will be made to generalize the code such that anyone with an understanding of a coding language will be comfortable.
Smart Cards
This course shows how smart cards are different compared to other type of cards. It is explained how smart cards can be used to realize confidentiality and integrity of information. Insight is given into the structure and operation of a smart card, the functionality of a smart card operating system and commonly used security mechanisms. In addition, an overview is given of developments in the field of chips (8, 16 and 32 bit architectures, co-processors), operating systems, virtual machines (Java Card, MULTOS), compatibility (PC / SC, Open Card, EMV) security evaluation (ITSEC, Common Criteria) and physical and logical attack methods (probing, SEM, FIB, DFA, DPA). Biometric identification and authentication using smart cards is dealt along with a summary of developments and (im) possibilities.
The Life of Binaries
Along the way we discuss the relevance of security at different stages of a binary's life, from the tricks that can be played by a malicious compiler, to how viruses really work, to the way which malware "packers" duplicate OS process execution functionality, to the benefit of a security-enhanced OS loader which implements address space layout randomization (ASLR).
Understanding Cryptology: Core Concepts
This is an introduction to cryptology with a focus on applied cryptology. It was designed to be accessible to a wide audience, and therefore does not include a rigorous mathematical foundation (this will be covered in later classes).
Understanding Cryptology: Cryptanalysis
A class for those who want to stop learning about building cryptographic systems and want to attack them. This course is a mixture of lecture designed to introduce students to a variety of code-breaking techniques and python labs to solidify those concepts. Unlike its sister class, Core Concepts, math is necessary for this topic. Don't have a math degree? A basic understanding of algebra is sufficient - the mathematical principles that are necessary for understanding are included in the lecture. Knowledge of programming is also necessary, and knowledge of python is very helpful.
Introduction to Software Exploits (Exploits 1)
Software vulnerabilities are flaws in program logic that can be leveraged by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a target system. This class will cover both the identification of software vulnerabilities and the techniques attackers use to exploit them. In addition, current techniques that attempt to remediate the threat of software vulnerability exploitation will be discussed.
Exploits 2: Exploitation in the Windows Environment
This course covers the exploitation of stack corruption vulnerabilities in the Windows environment. Stack overflows are programming flaws that often times allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of a vulnerable program. There are many nuances involved with exploiting these vulnerabilities in Windows. Window's exploit mitigations such as DEP, ASLR, SafeSEH, and SEHOP, makes leveraging these programming bugs more difficult, but not impossible. The course highlights the features and weaknesses of many the exploit mitigation techniques deployed in Windows operating systems. Also covered are labs that describe the process of finding bugs in Windows applications with mutation based fuzzing, and then developing exploits that target those bugs.
Intermediate Intel x86: Architecture, Assembly, Applications, & Alliteration
Building upon the Introductory Intel x86 class, this class goes into more depth on topics already learned, and introduces more advanced topics that dive deeper into how Intel-based systems work. Example applications include showing how hardware and memory mechanisms are used for software exploits, anti-debug techniques, rootkit hiding, and direct hardware access for keystroke logging.
Advanced x86: Virtualization with Intel VT-x
The purpose of this course is to provide a hands on introduction to Intel hardware support for virtualization. The first part will motivate the challenges of virtualization in the absence of dedicated hardware. This is followed by a deep dive on the Intel virtualization "API" and labs to begin implementing a blue pill / hyperjacking attack made famous by researchers like Joanna Rutkowska and Dino Dai Zovi et al. Finally a discussion of virtualization detection techniques.
Introduction to Reverse Engineering Software
Throughout the history of invention curious minds have sought to understand the inner workings of their gadgets. Whether investigating a broken watch, or improving an engine, these people have broken down their goods into their elemental parts to understand how they work. This is Reverse Engineering (RE), and it is done every day from recreating outdated and incompatible software, understanding malicious code, or exploiting weaknesses in software.
Reverse Engineering Malware
This class picks up where the Introduction to Reverse Engineering Software course left off, exploring how static reverse engineering techniques can be used to understand what a piece of malware does and how it can be removed.
Rootkits: What they are, and how to find them
Rootkits are a class of malware which are dedicated to hiding the attacker's presence on a compromised system. This class will focus on understanding how rootkits work, and what tools can be used to help find them. This will be a very hands-on class where we talk about specific techniques which rootkits use, and then do labs where we show how a proof of concept rootkit is able to hide things from a defender.
The Adventures of a Keystroke: An in-depth look into keylogging on Windows
Windows is designed to be compatible with a lot of devices which is why there are a lot of layers in the keystroke handling. The more layers a system has, the more probable it could be compromised by bad guys. There are more than 30 methods for capturing keystrokes from a Windows PC. Methods vary from simple user mode techniques to advanced ones such as IRP hooking. Class currently covers most of the user mode and kernel mode techniques including the undocumented ones which are not described anywhere else but there are still techniques which are not covered in the class such as Raw Input Devices. As for the hardware, we only cover PS/2 keyboards for the moment but documenting USB keyboards is one of the planned topics for near future.
Academic Courses
Florida State University's - Offensive Computer Security
The primary incentive for an attacker to exploit a vulnerability, or series of vulnerabilities is to achieve a return on an investment (his/her time usually). This return need not be strictly monetary, an attacker may be interested in obtaining access to data, identities, or some other commodity that is valuable to them. The field of penetration testing involves authorized auditing and exploitation of systems to assess actual system security in order to protect against attackers. This requires thorough knowledge of vulnerabilities and how to exploit them. Thus, this course provides an introductory but comprehensive coverage of the fundamental methodologies, skills, legal issues, and tools used in white hat penetration testing and secure system administration.
Offensive Computer Security - Spring 2014
Offensive Computer Security - Spring 2013
Florida State University's - Offensive Network Security
This class allows students to look deep into know protocols (i.e. IP, TCP, UDP) to see how an attacker can utilize these protocols to their advantage and how to spot issues in a network via captured network traffic. The first half of this course focuses on know protocols while the second half of the class focuses on reverse engineering unknown protocols. This class will utilize captured traffic to allow students to reverse the protocol by using known techniques such as incorporating bioinformatics introduced by Marshall Beddoe. This class will also cover fuzzing protocols to see if the server or client have vulnerabilities. Overall, a student finishing this class will have a better understanding of the network layers, protocols, and network communication and their interaction in computer networks.

Vulnhub
We all learn in different ways: in a group, by yourself, reading books, watching/listening to other people, making notes or things out for yourself. Learning the basics & understanding them is essential; this knowledge can be enforced by then putting it into practice.
Over the years people have been creating these resources and a lot of time has been put into them, creating 'hidden gems' of training material. However, unless you know of them, its hard to discover them.
So VulnHub was born to cover as many as possible, creating a catalogue of 'stuff' that is (legally) 'breakable, hackable & exploitable' - allowing you to learn in a safe environment and practise 'stuff' out. When something is added to VulnHub's database it will be indexed as best as possible, to try and give you the best match possible for what you're wishing to learn or experiment with.

A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography - Dan Boneh & Victor Shoup
This book is about constructing practical cruptosystems for which we can argue security under plausible assumptions. The book covers many constructions for different tasks in cryptography. For each task we define the required goal. To analyze the constructions, we develop a unified framework for doing cryptographic proofs. A reader who masters this framework will capable of applying it to new constructions that may not be covered in this book. We describe common mistakes to avoid as well as attacks on real-world systems that illustratre the importance of rigor in cryptography. We end every chapter with a fund application that applies the ideas in the chapter in some unexpected way.

Why Invest in Application Security? (2015)
Released: June 21, 2015
Running a business requires being cost-conscious and minimizing unnecessary spending. The benefits of ensuring in the security of your application are invisible to most companies, so often times they neglect to invest in secure software development as a cost-saving measure. What these companies don't realize is the potential cost (both financial and to brand reputation) a preventable data compromise can incur.
The average data breach costs millions of dollars in damage.
Investing more time and personnel to develop secure software is, for most companies, worth it to minimize this unnecessary risk to their bottom line.

Monitoring / Logging
justniffer - Justniffer is a network protocol analyzer that captures network traffic and produces logs in a customized way, can emulate Apache web server log files, track response times and extract all "intercepted" files from the HTTP traffic.
httpry - httpry is a specialized packet sniffer designed for displaying and logging HTTP traffic. It is not intended to perform analysis itself, but to capture, parse, and log the traffic for later analysis. It can be run in real-time displaying the traffic as it is parsed, or as a daemon process that logs to an output file. It is written to be as lightweight and flexible as possible, so that it can be easily adaptable to different applications.
ngrep - ngrep strives to provide most of GNU grep's common features, applying them to the network layer. ngrep is a pcap-aware tool that will allow you to specify extended regular or hexadecimal expressions to match against data payloads of packets. It currently recognizes IPv4/6, TCP, UDP, ICMPv4/6, IGMP and Raw across Ethernet, PPP, SLIP, FDDI, Token Ring and null interfaces, and understands BPF filter logic in the same fashion as more common packet sniffing tools, such as tcpdump and snoop.
passivedns - A tool to collect DNS records passively to aid Incident handling, Network Security Monitoring (NSM) and general digital forensics. PassiveDNS sniffs traffic from an interface or reads a pcap-file and outputs the DNS-server answers to a log file. PassiveDNS can cache/aggregate duplicate DNS answers in-memory, limiting the amount of data in the logfile without loosing the essens in the DNS answer.
sagan - Sagan uses a 'Snort like' engine and rules to analyze logs (syslog/event log/snmptrap/netflow/etc).
OSSEC - OSSEC is an Open Source Host-based Intrusion Detection System that performs log analysis, file integrity checking, policy monitoring, rootkit detection, real-time alerting and active response. It runs on most operating systems, including Linux, MacOS, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX and Windows.

Conpot - ICS/SCADA Honeypot. Conpot is a low interactive server side Industrial Control Systems honeypot designed to be easy to deploy, modify and extend. By providing a range of common industrial control protocols we created the basics to build your own system, capable to emulate complex infrastructures to convince an adversary that he just found a huge industrial complex. To improve the deceptive capabilities, we also provided the possibility to server a custom human machine interface to increase the honeypots attack surface. The response times of the services can be artificially delayed to mimic the behaviour of a system under constant load. Because we are providing complete stacks of the protocols, Conpot can be accessed with productive HMI's or extended with real hardware. Conpot is developed under the umbrella of the Honeynet Project and on the shoulders of a couple of very big giants.
Amun - Amun Python-based low-interaction Honeypot.
Glastopf - Glastopf is a Honeypot which emulates thousands of vulnerabilities to gather data from attacks targeting web applications. The principle behind it is very simple: Reply the correct response to the attacker exploiting the web application.

Kojoney - Kojoney is a low level interaction honeypot that emulates an SSH server. The daemon is written in Python using the Twisted Conch libraries.
HonSSH - HonSSH is a high-interaction Honey Pot solution. HonSSH will sit between an attacker and a honey pot, creating two separate SSH connections between them.
Bifrozt - Bifrozt is a NAT device with a DHCP server that is usually deployed with one NIC connected directly to the Internet and one NIC connected to the internal network. What differentiates Bifrozt from other standard NAT devices is its ability to work as a transparent SSHv2 proxy between an attacker and your honeypot. If you deployed an SSH server on Bifrozt’s internal network it would log all the interaction to a TTY file in plain text that could be viewed later and capture a copy of any files that were downloaded. You would not have to install any additional software, compile any kernel modules or use a specific version or type of operating system on the internal SSH server for this to work. It will limit outbound traffic to a set number of ports and will start to drop outbound packets on these ports when certain limits are exceeded.
HoneyDrive - HoneyDrive is the premier honeypot Linux distro. It is a virtual appliance (OVA) with Xubuntu Desktop 12.04.4 LTS edition installed. It contains over 10 pre-installed and pre-configured honeypot software packages such as Kippo SSH honeypot, Dionaea and Amun malware honeypots, Honeyd low-interaction honeypot, Glastopf web honeypot and Wordpot, Conpot SCADA/ICS honeypot, Thug and PhoneyC honeyclients and more. Additionally it includes many useful pre-configured scripts and utilities to analyze, visualize and process the data it can capture, such as Kippo-Graph, Honeyd-Viz, DionaeaFR, an ELK stack and much more. Lastly, almost 90 well-known malware analysis, forensics and network monitoring related tools are also present in the distribution.
Cuckoo Sandbox - Cuckoo Sandbox is an Open Source software for automating analysis of suspicious files. To do so it makes use of custom components that monitor the behavior of the malicious processes while running in an isolated environment.
Full Packet Capture / Forensic
tcpflow - tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient for protocol analysis and debugging. Each TCP flow is stored in its own file. Thus, the typical TCP flow will be stored in two files, one for each direction. tcpflow can also process stored 'tcpdump' packet flows.
Xplico - The goal of Xplico is extract from an internet traffic capture the applications data contained. For example, from a pcap file Xplico extracts each email (POP, IMAP, and SMTP protocols), all HTTP contents, each VoIP call (SIP), FTP, TFTP, and so on. Xplico isn’t a network protocol analyzer. Xplico is an open source Network Forensic Analysis Tool (NFAT).
Moloch - Moloch is an open source, large scale IPv4 packet capturing (PCAP), indexing and database system. A simple web interface is provided for PCAP browsing, searching, and exporting. APIs are exposed that allow PCAP data and JSON-formatted session data to be downloaded directly. Simple security is implemented by using HTTPS and HTTP digest password support or by using apache in front. Moloch is not meant to replace IDS engines but instead work along side them to store and index all the network traffic in standard PCAP format, providing fast access. Moloch is built to be deployed across many systems and can scale to handle multiple gigabits/sec of traffic.

T-Pot: A Multi-Honeypot Platform
Honeypot (Dionaea and kippo) setup script
Linux commands
Bmon: (Bandwidth Monitor) is a tool similar to nload that shows the traffic load over all the network interfaces on the system. The output also consists of a graph and a section with packet level details. Screenshot
Bwm-ng: (Bandwidth Monitor Next Generation) is another very simple real time network load monitor that reports a summary of the speed at which data is being transferred in and out of all available network interfaces on the system. Screenshot
CBM: (Color Bandwidth Meter) A tiny little simple bandwidth monitor that displays the traffic volume through network interfaces. No further options, just the traffic stats are display and updated in realtime. Screenshot
Collectl: reports system statistics in a style that is similar to dstat, and like dstat it is gathers statistics about various different system resources like cpu, memory, network etc. Over here is a simple example of how to use it to report network usage/bandwidth. Screenshot
Dstat: is a versatile tool (written in python) that can monitor different system statistics and report them in a batch style mode or log the data to a csv or similar file. This example shows how to use dstat to report network bandwidth Screenshot
Ifstat: reports the network bandwidth in a batch style mode. The output is in a format that is easy to log and parse using other programs or utilities. Screenshot
Iftop: measures the data flowing through individual socket connections, and it works in a manner that is different from Nload. Iftop uses the pcap library to capture the packets moving in and out of the network adapter, and then sums up the size and count to find the total bandwidth under use. Although iftop reports the bandwidth used by individual connections, it cannot report the process name/id involved in the particular socket connection. But being based on the pcap library, iftop is able to filter the traffic and report bandwidth usage over selected host connections as specified by the filter. Screenshot
Iptraf: is an interactive and colorful IP Lan monitor. It shows individual connections and the amount of data flowing between the hosts. Screenshot
Jnettop: Jnettop is a traffic visualiser, which captures traffic going through the host it is running from and displays streams sorted by bandwidth they use. Screenshot
Nethogs: is a small 'net top' tool that shows the bandwidth used by individual processes and sorts the list putting the most intensive processes on top. In the event of a sudden bandwidth spike, quickly open nethogs and find the process responsible. Nethogs reports the PID, user and the path of the program. Screenshot
Netload: displays a small report on the current traffic load, and the total number of bytes transferred since the program start. No more features are there. Its part of the netdiag. Screenshot
Netwatch: is part of the netdiag collection of tools, and it too displays the connections between local host and other remote hosts, and the speed at which data is transferring on each connection. Screenshot
Nload: is a commandline tool that allows users to monitor the incoming and outgoing traffic separately. It also draws outa graph to indicate the same, the scale of which can be adjusted. Easy and simple to use, and does not support many options. Screenshot
Pktstat: displays all the active connections in real time, and the speed at which data is being transferred through them. It also displays the type of the connection, i.e. tcp or udp and also details about http requests if involved. Screenshot
Slurm: is 'yet' another network load monitor that shows device statistics along with an ascii graph. It supports 3 different styles of graphs each of which can be activated using the c, s and l keys. Simple in features, slurm does not display any further details about the network load. Screenshot
Speedometer: Another small and simple tool that just draws out good looking graphs of incoming and outgoing traffic through a given interface. Screenshot
Tcptrack: is similar to iftop, and uses the pcap library to capture packets and calculate various statistics like the bandwidth used in each connection. It also supports the standard pcap filters that can be used to monitor specific connections. Screenshot
Trafshow: reports the current active connections, their protocol and the data transfer speed on each connection. It can filter out connections using pcap type filters. Screenshot
Vnstat: is bit different from most of the other tools. It actually runs a background service/daemon and keeps recording the size of data transfer all the time. Next it can be used to generate a report of the history of network usage. Screenshot
Traffic Capture
Libpcap/Tcpdump: The official site of tcpdump, a powerful command-line packet analyzer; and libpcap, a portable C/C++ library for network traffic capture.
Ngrep: strives to provide most of GNU grep's common features, applying them to the network layer. ngrep is a pcap-aware tool that will allow you to specify extended regular or hexadecimal expressions to match against data payloads of packets. It currently recognizes TCP, UDP and ICMP across Ethernet, PPP, SLIP, FDDI, Token Ring and null interfaces, and understands bpf filter logic in the same fashion as more common packet sniffing tools, such as tcpdump and snoop.
clj-net-pcap: clj-net-pcap is a packet capturing library for Clojure. clj-net-pcap uses jNetPcap and adds convenience functionality around jNetPcap for easing the usability. A paper on clj-net-pcap was published in scope of COMPSACW 2014.
jNetPcap: jNetPcap is a packet capturing library for Java that is available for Linux and Windows. jNetPcap leverages libpcap respectively WinPcap and employs the Java Native Interface (JNI) for using the functionality provided by libpcap/WinPcap.
Moloch: Moloch is a open source large scale full PCAP capturing, indexing and database system.
n2disk (Commercial): A multi-Gigabit network traffic recorder with indexing capabilities. n2disk is a network traffic recorder application. With n2disk you can capture full- sized network packets at multi-Gigabit rate (above 10 Gigabit/s on adequate hardware) from a live network interface, and write them into files without any packet loss.
OpenFPC: OpenFPC is a set of scripts that combine to provide a lightweight full-packet network traffic recorder & buffering tool. Its design goal is to allow non-expert users to deploy a distributed network traffic recorder on COTS hardware while integrating into existing alert and log tools.
PF_RING: PF_RING is a new type of network socket that dramatically improves the packet capture speed. Available for Linux kernels 2.6.32 and newer. No need to patch the kernel. PF_RING-aware drivers for increased packet capture acceleration.
TTT: (Tele Traffic Tapper) is yet another descendant of tcpdump but it is capable of real-time, graphical, and remote traffic-monitoring. ttt won't replace tcpdump, rather, it helps you find out what to look into with tcpdump. ttt monitors the network and automatically picks up the main contributors of the traffic within the time window. The graphs are updated every second by default.
Yaf: It's a reliable piece of software, quite solid and able to generate flow records from pcap. This is very nice for indexing huge pcap or even doing packet capture. The recent version can even extract payloads and put in the flow records.
Traffic Analysis/Inspection
AIEngine: is a next generation interactive/programmable packet inspection engine with capabilities of learning without any human intervention, NIDS functionality, DNS domain classification, network collector and many others. AIEngine also helps network/security professionals to identify traffic and develop signatures for use them on NIDS, Firewalls, Traffic classifiers and so on.
Bro: is an open-source, Unix-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that passively monitors network traffic and looks for suspicious activity. Bro detects intrusions by first parsing network traffic to extract its application- level semantics and then executing event-oriented analyzers that compare the activity with patterns deemed troublesome. Its analysis includes detection of specific attacks (including those defined by signatures, but also those defined in terms of events) and unusual activities (e.g., certain hosts connecting to certain services, or patterns of failed connection attempts).
CapTipper: Malicious HTTP traffic explorer
Chopshop: is a MITRE developed framework to aid analysts in the creation and execution of pynids based decoders and detectors of APT tradecraft.
CoralReef: is a software suite developed by CAIDA to analyze data collected by passive Internet traffic monitors. It provides a programming library libcoral, similar to libpcap with extensions for ATM and other network types, which is available from both C and Perl.
DPDK: is a set of libraries and drivers for fast packet processing. It was designed to run on any processors. The first supported CPU was Intel x86 and it is now extended to IBM Power 8, EZchip TILE-Gx and ARM. It runs mostly in Linux userland. A FreeBSD port is available for a subset of DPDK features.
DPKT: Python packet creation/parsing library.
ECap: (External Capture) is a distributed network sniffer with a web front- end. Ecap was written many years ago in 2005, but a post on the tcpdump-workers mailing list requested a similar application... so here it is. It would be fun to update it and work on it again if there's any interest.
EtherApe: is a graphical network monitor for Unix modeled after etherman. Featuring link layer, ip and TCP modes, it displays network activity graphically. Hosts and links change in size with traffic. Color coded protocols display. It supports Ethernet, FDDI, Token Ring, ISDN, PPP and SLIP devices. It can filter traffic to be shown, and can read traffic from a file as well as live from the network.
HttpSniffer: A multi-threading tool to sniff TCP flow statistics and embedded HTTP headers from PCAP file. Each TCP flow carrying HTTP is exported to text file in JSON format.
Ipsumdump: summarizes TCP/IP dump files into a self-describing ASCII format easily readable by humans and programs. Ipsumdump can read packets from network interfaces, from tcpdump files, and from existing ipsumdump files. It will transparently uncompress tcpdump or ipsumdump files when necessary. It can randomly sample traffic, filter traffic based on its contents, anonymize IP addresses, and sort packets from multiple dumps by timestamp. Also, it can optionally create a tcpdump file containing actual packet data. It's also convenient to work with CLICK as a inserted module.
ITA: The Internet Traffic Archive is a moderated repository to support widespread access to traces of Internet network traffic, sponsored by ACM SIGCOMM. The traces can be used to study network dynamics, usage characteristics, and growth patterns, as well as providing the grist for trace- driven simulations. The archive is also open to programs for reducing raw trace data to more manageable forms, for generating synthetic traces, and for analyzing traces.
Libcrafter: is a high level library for C++ designed to make easier the creation and decoding of network packets. It is able to craft or decode packets of most common network protocols, send them on the wire, capture them and match requests and replies.
Libnet: is a collection of routines to help with the construction and handling of network packets. It provides a portable framework for low-level network packet shaping, handling and injection. Libnet features portable packet creation interfaces at the IP layer and link layer, as well as a host of supplementary and complementary functionality. Using libnet, quick and simple packet assembly applications can be whipped up with little effort.
Libnids: designed by Rafal Wojtczuk, is an implementation of an E-component of Network Intrusion Detection System. It emulates the IP stack of Linux 2.0.x. Libnids offers IP defragmentation, TCP stream assembly and TCP port scan detection. The most valuable feature of libnids is reliability. A number of tests were conducted, which proved that libnids predicts behaviour of protected Linux hosts as closely as possible.
Multitail: now has a colorscheme included for monitoring the tcpdump output. It can also filter, convert timestamps to timestrings and much more.
Netsniff-ng: Netsniff-ng is a toolkit of free Linux networking utilities, a Swiss army knife for your daily Linux network plumbing if you will.
NetDude: (NETwork DUmp data Displayer and Editor). From their webpage, "it is a GUI-based tool that allows you to make detailed changes to packets in tcpdump tracefiles."
Network Expect: is a framework that allows to easily build tools that can interact with network traffic. Following a script, traffic can be injected into the network, and decisions can be taken, and acted upon, based on received network traffic. An interpreted language provides branching and high-level control structures to direct the interaction with the network. Network Expect uses libpcap for packet capture and libwireshark (from the Wireshark project) for packet dissection tasks. (GPL, BSD/Linux/OSX).
Ntop: Ntop is a network traffic probe that shows the network usage, similar to what the popular top Unix command does. ntop is based on libpcap and it has been written in a portable way in order to virtually run on every Unix platform and on Win32 as well.
Ntopng: Ntopng is the next generation version of the original ntop, a network traffic probe that shows the network usage, similar to what the popular top Unix command does. ntop is based on libpcap and it has been written in a portable way in order to virtually run on every Unix platform, MacOSX and on Win32 as well.
Pcap2har: A program to convert .pcap network capture files to HTTP Archive files using library dpkt.
pkt2flow: A simple utility to classify packets into flows. It's so simple that only one task is aimed to finish. For Deep Packet Inspection or flow classification, it's so common to analyze the feature of one specific flow. I have make the attempt to use made-ready tools like tcpflows, tcpslice, tcpsplit, but all these tools try to either decrease the trace volume (under requirement) or resemble the packets into flow payloads (over requirement). I have not found a simple tool to classify the packets into flows without further processing.
potiron: Normalizes, indexes, enriches and visualizes network captures.
pyshark: A Python wrapper for tshark, allowing python packet parsing using wireshark dissectors. There are quite a few python packet parsing modules, this one is different because it doesn't actually parse any packets, it simply uses tshark's (wireshark command-line utility) ability to export XMLs to use its parsing.
Sanitize: Sanitize is a collection of five Bourne shell scripts for reducing tcpdump traces in order to address security and privacy concerns, by renumbering hosts and stripping out packet contents. Each script takes as input a tcpdump trace file and generates to stdout a reduced, ASCII file in fixed-column format.
Scapy: Scapy is a powerful interactive packet manipulation program. It is able to forge or decode packets of a wide number of protocols, send them on the wire, capture them, match requests and replies, and much more. It can easily handle most classical tasks like scanning, tracerouting, probing, unit tests, attacks or network discovery (it can replace hping, 85% of nmap, arpspoof, arp-sk, arping, tcpdump, tethereal, p0f, etc.). It also performs very well at a lot of other specific tasks that most other tools can't handle, like sending invalid frames, injecting your own 802.11 frames, combining technics (VLAN hopping+ARP cache poisoning, VOIP decoding on WEP encrypted channel, ...), etc.
Sniff: Makes output from the tcpdump program easier to read and parse.
Snort: Snort is an open source network intrusion prevention and detection system (IDS/IPS) developed by Sourcefire, now owned by Cisco. Combining the benefits of signature, protocol and anomaly- based inspection, Snort is the most widely deployed IDS/IPS technology worldwide. With millions of downloads and approximately 500,000 registered users, Snort has become the de facto standard for IPS.
Socket Sentry: Socket Sentry is a real-time network traffic monitor for KDE Plasma in the same spirit as tools like iftop and netstat.
TCP-Reduce: TCP-Reduce is a collection of Bourne shell scripts for reducing tcpdump traces to one-line summaries of each TCP connection present in the trace. The scripts look only at TCP SYN/FIN/RST packets. Connections without SYN packets in the trace (such as those on- going at the beginning of the trace) will not appear in the summary. Garbaged packets (those missing some of their contents) are reported to stderr as bogon's and are discarded. Occasionally the script gets fooled by retransmissions with altered sequence numbers, and reports erroneous huge connection sizes - always check large connections (say 100 MB or more) for plausibility.
Tcpdpriv: Tcpdpriv is program for eliminating confidential information (user data and addresses) from packets collected on a network interface (or, from trace files created using the -w argument to tcpdump). Tcpdpriv removes the payload of TCP and UDP, and the entire IP payload for other protocols. It implements several address scrambling methods; the sequential numbering method and its variants, and a hash method with preserving address prefix.
Tcpflow: A program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient for protocol analysis or debugging. A program like 'tcpdump' shows a summary of packets seen on the wire, but usually doesn't store the data that's actually being transmitted. In contrast, tcpflow reconstructs the actual data streams and stores each flow in a separate file for later analysis. Original link.
Tcplook: Tracelook is an Tcl/TK program for graphically viewing the contents of trace files created using the -w argument to tcpdump. Tracelook should look at all protocols, but presently only looks at TCP connections. The program is slow and uses system resources prodigiously.
Tcpreplay: Replays a pcap file on an interface using libnet.
Tcpslice: Tcpslice is a tool for extracting portions of packet trace files generated using tcpdump's -w flag. It can combine multiple trace files, and/or extract portions of one or more traces based on time. From the tcpdump CVS server.
Tcpsplit: A tool to break a single libpcap packet trace into some number of sub- traces, breaking the trace along TCP connection boundaries so that a TCP connection doesn't end up split across two sub-traces. This is useful for making large trace files tractable for in- depth analysis and for subsetting a trace for developing analysis on only part of a trace.
Tcpstat: Tcpstat reports certain network interface statistics much like vmstat does for system statistics. tcpstat gets its information by either monitoring a specific interface, or by reading previously saved tcpdump data from a file.
Tcptrace: A tool written by Shawn Ostermann at Ohio University, for analysis of TCP dump files. It can take as input the files produced by several popular packet- capture programs, including tcpdump, snoop, etherpeek, HP Net Metrix, and WinDump. tcptrace can produce several different types of output containing information on each connection seen, such as elapsed time, bytes and segments sent and received, retransmissions, round trip times, window advertisements, throughput, and more. It can also produce a number of graphs for further analysis.
TraceWrangler: TraceWrangler is a network capture file toolkit running on Windows (or on Linux, using WINE) that supports PCAP as well as the new PCAPng file format, which is now the standard file format used by Wireshark. The most prominent use case for TraceWrangler is the easy sanitization and anonymization of PCAP and PCAPng files (sometimes called "trace files", "capture files" or "packet captures"), removing or replacing sensitive data while being easy to use.
Tstat: A passive sniffer able to provide several insight on the traffic patterns at both the network and transport levels with a tremendous set of flow features.
WAND: A wonderful collection of tools built on libtrace to process network traffic, which is from The University of Waikato. I love this project!
WinPcap: An extract of a message from Guy Harris on state of WinPcap and WinDump.
Wireshark suit: The well-known tool suit to support packet analyzer and protocol decoder. It also includes a few practical tools and scripts to support most of the common usage.
Xplot: The program xplot was written in the late 1980s to support the analysis of TCP packet traces.
yaraPcap: Process HTTP Pcaps With YARA
yaraprocessor: With yaraprocessor YARA can be run against individual packet payloads as well as a concatenation of some or all of the payloads. It was originally written for use in Chopshop, but can also be used without it.
DNS Utilities
dnsgram: dnsgram is a debugging tool for intermittent resolver failures. it takes one or more input PCAP files and generates statistics on 5 second segments allowing the study of intermittent resolver issues.
dnsreplay: Dnsreplay takes recorded questions and answers and replays them to the specified nameserver and reporting afterwards which percentage of answers matched, were worse or better. Then compares the answers and some other metrics with the actual ones with those found in the dumpfile.
dnsscan: dnsscan takes one or more INFILEs in PCAP format and generates a list of the number of queries per query type.
dnsscope: dnsscope takes an input PCAP and generates some simple statistics outputs these to console.
dnswasher: dnswasher takes an input file in PCAP format and writes out a PCAP file, while obfuscating end-user IP addresses. This is useful to share data with third parties while attempting to protect the privacy of your users.
File Extraction
Chaosreader: A freeware tool to trace TCP/UDP/... sessions and fetch application data from snoop or tcpdump logs. This is a type of "any-snarf" program, as it will fetch telnet sessions, FTP files, HTTP transfers (HTML, GIF, JPEG, ...), SMTP emails, ... from the captured data inside network traffic logs. A html index file is created that links to all the session details, including realtime replay programs for telnet, rlogin, IRC, X11 and VNC sessions; and reports such as image reports and HTTP GET/POST content reports.
Dsniff: Dsniff is a collection of tools for network auditing and penetration testing. dsniff, filesnarf, mailsnarf, msgsnarf, urlsnarf, and webspy passively monitor a network for interesting data (passwords, e-mail, files, etc.). arpspoof, dnsspoof, and macof facilitate the interception of network traffic normally unavailable to an attacker (e.g, due to layer-2 switching). sshmitm and webmitm implement active monkey-in-the-middle attacks against redirected SSH and HTTPS sessions by exploiting weak bindings in ad-hoc PKI.
Foremost: is a console program to recover files based on their headers, footers, and internal data structures. This process is commonly referred to as data carving. Foremost can work on image files, such as those generated by dd, Safeback, Encase, etc, or directly on a drive. The headers and footers can be specified by a configuration file or you can use command line switches to specify built-in file types. These built-in types look at the data structures of a given file format allowing for a more reliable and faster recovery.
Justniffer: Justniffer is a network protocol analyzer that captures network traffic and produces logs in a customized way, can emulate Apache web server log files, track response times and extract all "intercepted" files from the HTTP traffic.
NetworkMiner: NetworkMiner is a Network Forensic Analysis Tool (NFAT) for Windows (but also works in Linux / Mac OS X / FreeBSD). NetworkMiner can be used as a passive network sniffer/packet capturing tool in order to detect operating systems, sessions, hostnames, open ports etc. without putting any traffic on the network. NetworkMiner can also parse PCAP files for off-line analysis and to regenerate/ reassemble transmitted files and certificates from PCAP files.
pcapfex - Packet CAPture Forensic Evidence eXtractor (pcapfex) is a tool that finds and extracts files from packet capture files. Its power lies in its ease of use. Just provide it a pcap file, and it will try to extract all of the files. It is an extensible platform, so additional file types to recognize and extract can be added easily.
scalpel: Scalpel is an open source data carving tool.
Snort: is an open source network intrusion prevention and detection system (IDS/IPS) developed by Sourcefire, now owned by Cisco. Combining the benefits of signature, protocol and anomaly- based inspection, Snort is the most widely deployed IDS/IPS technology worldwide.
Tcpick: is a textmode sniffer libpcap-based that can track, reassemble and reorder tcp streams. Tcpick is able to save the captured flows in different files or displays them in the terminal, and so it is useful to sniff files that are transmitted via ftp or http. It can display all the stream on the terminal, when the connection is closed in different display modes like hexdump, hexdump + ascii, only printable characters, raw mode and so on.
Tcpxtract: is a tool for extracting files from network traffic based on file signatures. Extracting files based on file type headers and footers (sometimes called "carving") is an age old data recovery technique.
Xplico: The goal of Xplico is extract from an internet traffic capture the applications data contained. For example, from a pcap file Xplico extracts each email (POP, IMAP, and SMTP protocols), all HTTP contents, each VoIP call (SIP), FTP, TFTP, and so on. Xplico isn't a network protocol analyzer. Xplico is an open source Network Forensic An alysis Tool (NFAT). Xplico is released under the GNU General Public License and with some scripts under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0) License.

BPF+: Exploiting Global Data-flow Optimization in a Generalized Packet Filter Architecture By Andrew Begel, Steven McCanne, and Susan Graham.
FFT-FGN-C: is a program for synthesizing a type of self-similar process known as fractional Gaussian noise. The program is fast but approximate. Fractional Gaussian noise is only one type of self-similar process. When using this program for synthesizing network traffic, you must keep in mind that it may be that the traffic you seek is better modeled using one of the other processes.
Haka: An open source security oriented language which allows to describe protocols and apply security policies on (live) captured traffic. The scope of Haka language is twofold. First of all, it allows to write security rules in order to filter/alter/drop unwanted packets and log and report malicious activities. Second, Haka features a grammar enabling to specify network protocols and their underlying state machine.
RIPE-NCC Hadoop for PCAP: A Hadoop library to read packet capture (PCAP) files. Bundles the code used to read PCAPs. Can be used within MapReduce jobs to natively read PCAP files. Also features a Hive Serializer/Deserializer (SerDe) to query PCAPs using SQL like commands.
Traffic Data Repository at the WIDE Project: It becomes increasingly important for both network researchers and operators to know the trend of network traffic and to find anomaly in their network traffic. This paper describes an on-going effort within the WIDE project to collect a set of free tools to build a traffic data repository containing detailed information of our backbone traffic. Traffic traces are collected by tcpdump and, after removing privacy information, the traces are made open to the public. We review the issues on user privacy, and then, the tools used to build the WIDE traffic repository. We will report the current status and findings in the early stage of our IPv6 deployment.
Usenix93 Paper on BPF: The libpcap interface supports a filtering mechanism based on the architecture in the BSD packet filter. BPF is described in the 1993 Winter Usenix paper "The BSD Packet Filter: A New Architecture for User-level Packet Capture".
